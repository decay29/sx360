August 5, 2007 - Initial Release


Version 1.1 - November 13, 2007

This version fixes some bugs, and some glaring omissions.  First, the sxPunchFile::getRecordCount function was never implemented.  This has been corrected.  There were other signed/unsigned oversights on my behalf that have also been fixed.  These related to navigating to the first record, or the use of an sxIndex.

Version 2.0 - November 27, 2007

Event handling has been added.  The sxRecord::fillPunch function has been fixed.  There was a bug that would wipe out the whole column instead of just one punch when called.
